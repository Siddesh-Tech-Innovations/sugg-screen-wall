## Current docs/ Structure:

```
docs/
├── README.md                    # Documentation index
├── INTEGRATION_SETUP.md         # Setup guide (emoji-free)
├── INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md      # Integration summary (emoji-free)
├── Backend-Documentation.md     # API documentation
├── Functional Architecture.png  # Architecture diagram
└── Tech Architecture.png        # Technical diagram
```

## Root Directory:
- Clean - no documentation files remaining in root
- Only essential project folders: backend/, frontend/, docs/, myscript-sdk/

All documentation is now properly organized in the docs/ folder and completely free of emojis as requested.
